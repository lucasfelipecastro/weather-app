# Weather App üå¶Ô∏è

A simple weather application built using Python and PyQt5 that retrieves and displays weather information based on a given city name. The app uses the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data and displays it in an intuitive graphical interface, complete with weather descriptions and emojis representing current conditions.

## Features

- Get weather data by city name üåç
- Display temperature in Fahrenheit and a description of weather conditions
- Icons/emojis for visual representation of the weather
- Error handling for network and API-related issues

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Requests library for handling HTTP requests

To install PyQt5 and requests, you can run:

```bash
    pip install PyQt5 requests
```

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
